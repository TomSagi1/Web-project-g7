                <h2>Welcome to Brooklyn Hair Saloon!</h2>
                <p>The founder of the business, Lin Halevi, started her barbering career as an inexperienced 17 year old working in a ‘GVANIM’ barber shop in Rishon Letsiyon.
                    As one of the very first women to enter into this male dominated world, Lin could clearly see a gap in the market away from the impersonal experience of a
                    traditional barbers and the perming lotions and colourings of the unisex hairdresser. She could see that men were looking for (and continue to seek today)
                    an enjoyable and relaxing haircut or shave, in a comfortable and friendly, yet masculine, environment. In 2021 Lin opened her first Barber Shop in Rishon
                    Letsiyon, offering men the efficient yet enjoyable haircutting, styling and shaving experience they had been searching for.
